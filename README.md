# üìä Data Domain Jobs Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview
Our client, a recruitment and selection firm, recently acquired a **large volume of job market data** from multiple sources to respond to a surge in job inquiries within the data field.  
The data was highly **disorganised, inconsistent, and fragmented**, making it challenging to extract actionable insights.  
This project involved **data cleaning, structuring, integration, and visualization** using **Power BI**, ensuring optimal performance with over **700,000+ rows of data**.

---

## üõ† Problem Statement
The client faced difficulties in:
1. **Understanding hiring trends** over the years to optimise recruitment strategies.
2. **Analysing job type distribution** (Onsite, Hybrid, Remote) across different years.
3. **Identifying highest job openings per country and year** for targeted recruitment.
4. **Tracking average companies hiring over time** to gauge market activity.
5. **Determining top 3 job fields yearly** for strategic workforce planning.
6. **Identifying most in-demand skills** to align with market needs.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Challenges
- **Data Inconsistencies & Missing Information**  
  - Unstructured job descriptions with embedded critical details.
- **Fragmented Data Tables**  
  - Multiple poorly connected datasets from various sources.
- **Large Dataset Size**  
  - 700K+ rows required performance-optimised Power BI reports.
- **Integration Needs**  
  - Creation of a consolidated database schema for future use.

## Data Cleaning
- During the process, a **skills-related data issue** was identified ‚Äî multiple skills for the same **Job_id** were stored in separate rows.  
To solve this, **Python** was used to **aggregate all skills for each job into a single record**, ensuring a cleaner, more structured dataset before loading into **Power BI**. 
- In **Power Query (M Language)**, logic was applied to:
- Classify **Job Employment Types** (Full-Time, Part-Time, Contract, Internship, Temporary, Freelance, Permanent, Not Specified) based on keywords in the `SUMMARY` column.
- Standardize **Job Titles** into defined categories (e.g., Business Analyst, Cloud Engineer, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Senior roles, Software Engineer) by scanning and matching patterns in the `JOB_TITLE` column.
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized column naming.
- Ensured relationships between tables were correctly defined before loading into the Power BI model.
